# Pet-projects
Welcome to view my personal projects! 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first project that I chose to do was analyzing mass shooting in the USA from 1924 to 2022. The reason why I chose this dataset is that one of the biggest debating
issues in the US is the gun control policy. Thereby, I set myself some tasks to see:
1. In which states and cities mass shootings happened mostly.
2. Count the average mortality rate for each state and witness that this index does not prove that states with high mortality rate are the most dangerous ones,
but the opposite. 
3. Get the general view on how the number of mass shootings changed over almost a century.
4. Also get the view on how the number changes in each month. 
5. Calculate in which places and at which time of the day mass shootings usually happen.

The second project is analyzing the most popular streaming service Netflix. 
The tasks:
1. Get a number for each type of entertainment, movies and TV shows.
2. Get a statistic on which ratings are the most popular on the platform.
3. Get a number of released movies/TV shows over the years.
4. Get a rating of actors and directors based on the amount of movies/TV shows they appeared in/directed.
5. Also, get a rating for genres for movies and TV shows seperately.
